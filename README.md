# CircleCI Dockerfile Wizard

Easily build Docker images with different versions/combinations of common languages/dependencies, for use on CircleCI.

## Prerequisites

- [CircleCI account](https://circleci.com/signup)
- [Octanner Quay repository account](https://quay.octanner.io) (Docker itself **does not** need to be installed on your computer)
- [Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) & [Perl](https://perl.org) (included in most macOS & Linux installations)

## Usage

**1.** Clone this repository and start building it on CircleCI

**2.** Enter the cloned `dockerfile-wizard` directory and run `make ready` to prepare the `config.yml` file for building Docker images on CircleCI

**3.** Run `make setup` in the cloned directory, or else manually add the versions/dependencies that you need to `.circleci/config.yml` as specified in the [`image_config` section](https://github.com/octanner/dockerfile-wizard/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml)

**4.** Commit and push your changes

Once the build has finished, your image will be available at `https://quay.octanner.io/organization/developer/IMAGE_NAME` and can be used in other projects building on CircleCI (or anywhere else!). The Dockerfile for your image will be stored as an artifact in this project's `build` job.

**5.** Run `make reset` and commit and push your changes

**Note: After the build is success in CircleCI, you must commit the changes to `config.yml` after running `make reset` or else other people won't be able to use this project to create a new image again.**

### How it works

1. The `setup` script adds your requested version information to the config.yml file as environment variables
1. The `generate.sh` script runs on CircleCI and generates a Dockerfile based on those environment variables
1. CircleCI builds your Docker image from the generated Dockerfile, deploys it using your Docker credentials, and then tests your image using [Bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats), which we install in every Docker image built via this repository

### Notes

- The portions of this repository that run on your local computer are intended for Linux/macOS operating systems; they may not work on Windows
- This repository has not been tested with every possible permutation of versions/dependencies, and you may encounter errors with some combinations of various languages/tools. If your `build` job fails, check its `docker build` stepâ€”there's likely a compilation error with a particular version of Ruby, Node, or Python.
